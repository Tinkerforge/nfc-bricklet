This is the original "NfcLibrary" from NXP. We leave this here to be
able to get a diff of our changes.

Since the NfcLibrary does not have a version number, this is always the version
our fork is based on. If we want to update to a new NfcLibrary, we first
can diff to this version to see the differences, merge them with our
fork and then update this .orig folder to the newer version.
